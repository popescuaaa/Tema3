# Using Neural Nets to Recognize Handwritten Digits
In computer vision the most difficult task is to
recognize the handwritten digit. Since the last
decade the handwritten digit recognition is
gaining more and more fame because of its
potential range of applications like bank
cheque analysis, recognizing postal addresses
on postal cards, etc. Handwritten digit
recognition plays a very vital role in day to
day life, like in a form of recording of
information and style of communication even
with the addition of new emerging techniques.
The performance of Handwritten digit
recognition system is highly depend upon two
things: First it depends on feature extraction
techniques which is used to increase the
performance of the system and improve the
recognition rate and the second is the neural
network approach which takes lots of
training data and automatically infer the rule
for matching it with the correct pattern. In
this paper we have focused on different
methods of handwritten digit recognition that
uses both feature extraction techniques and
neural network approaches and presented a
comparative analysis while discussing pros
and cons of each method.
Index Terms:Handwritten Digit Recognition;
feature extraction; neural network.
